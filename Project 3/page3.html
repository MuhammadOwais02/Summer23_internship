                    To the best of our understanding, the virus is primarily
                    spread through contact and respiratory droplets. Under some circumstances
                    airborne transmission may occur (such as when aerosol generating
                    procedures are conducted in health care settings or potentially,
                    in indoor crowded poorly ventilated settings elsewhere).
